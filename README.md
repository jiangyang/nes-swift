# nes-swift
An attempt to port https://github.com/fogleman/nes in Swift, an experiment to learn Swift and compare it with Go.

It is not feature complete and probably will never be. There is no audio. It only supports NROM roms. The performance is not good(yet?).
With `-Ofast` optimization, games are playable but frame rate is still laggy.
