# nes-swift
An attempt to port https://github.com/fogleman/nes in Swift, an experiment to learn Swift and compare with Go.

It is not feature complete and prob will never be. There is no audio. It only supports NROM roms. The performance is not good(yet?).
With `-Ofast` optimization, games are playable but frame rate is still not quite on par with mature emulators.
